    <img src="recipe.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Fresh tomatoes and a rich, cheesy filling make a summertime savory pie. There is a lot of preparation for this pie, but it is well worth every minute. </p>
    <p>I love this pie on summer mountain evenings. Enjoy with cool ice tea.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch pie crust</li>
        <li>2 pounds heirloom tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced leek</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh basil, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the lower oven rack.</li>
        <li>Line a deep-dish, 9-inch pie plate with dough. Place 2 layers of aluminum foil over the entire surface. Fill with pie weights or dried beans.</li>
        <li>Remove pie crust and allow to cool. Continue baking the tomatoes until they are wilted, about 40 minutes total. Remove and allow to cool. Keep the oven on.</li>
        <li>Bake until browned and bubbly on top, about 40 minutes. Cool completely before serving.</li>
